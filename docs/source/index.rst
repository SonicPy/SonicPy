Welcome to sonicPy's user guide!
===================================

Sound velocity in a material can be estimated by an experimental measurements of the wave travel distance (d) and the wave travel time (t) 

v = d/t	

The data analysis package sonicPy consists of two GUI programs, Image-Analysis and Time-of-Flight that allow to estimate the values of d and t, respectively.  

The goal of the Image-Analysis program is to perform measurements of the sample-thickness in the experimentally recorded radiography images. The sample-thickness corresponds to the travel distance (d) of the ultrasound wave. 

The Time-of-Flight program is used to determine the time shift between a series of experimentally recorded ultrasound echoes by performing cross-correlation. In addition, the inverse frequency (f) module inside of the Time-of-Flight program may be used to improve the travel time estimation by preforming the multiple-frequency analysis.
